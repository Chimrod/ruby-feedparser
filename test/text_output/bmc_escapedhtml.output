So MIT's Technology Review[1] has named me as one of theirTR35[2] -- the top 35 innovators under the age of thirty-five.  It's a great honor, especially because the otherhonorees are /actually/ working on things likecures for cancer[3]androcket science[4] -- domainsthat I have known only as rhetorical flourish.Should you like to hear me make a jackass out of myself on the subject, you mightwant to check outRichard Giles[5]'slatest I/O podcast[6],in which he interviewed me about the award.
