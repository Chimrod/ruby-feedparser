Since politics is (are?) on my mind lately, I want to point outan interesting site, PoliticalSurvey[1], which I first discovered when EricMeyer pointed it out[2] back in February.

It's interesting because it uses principalcomponent analysis[3] to derive the axes from the data, rather thantrying to pick axes in advance.  It's also interesting because the mostsignificant axis it finds is the traditional left/right axis, but thesecond axis isn't the libertarian/authoritarian axis that some assertshould be the second axis–rather, it's a pragmatic/idealisticaxis.

I've taken the survey twice, once in February and once today.  Myresults were similar:  I was in the left/pragmatic quadrant[4] bothtimes.  (In February, I was -4.08 on right/left and +5.17 onpragmatic/idealistic.  Today I was -3.63 on right/left and +4.65 onpragmatic/idealistic.)

My 1GB DIMM arrived Monday, and it works fine.  With memory pricesthese days, getting that is much easier than worrying about fixing a badmemory slot.CSS error reporting is now enabled in trunk Mozilla builds.  Checkout the “Javascript Console”.I compiled a custom Linux kernel Tuesday to try to get suspend andresume working on my laptop, but it didn't help.  My display stilldoesn't wake up on resume.  And perhaps other things don't either.  It'sa little hard to tell.  (The patches were the first patch and the secondvariant of the second patch on a page about Linux on theDell D600[1].  I have a Dell Inspiron 5150, but the video card is thesame).  I'll probably continue trying to get it working another time.I wish GNU ld's --gc-sections option worked for sharedlibraries.  (Even working when shared libraries are visible within fivemiles would be nice!)  The main thing this would help Mozilla with isgetting rid of unneeded copies of constructors and destructors that gcc[2]'s C++ compiler emits.  And probablyalso some unneeded vtables.  And maybe a good bit of other stuff.(gcc could probably be a little better, but it's really a job for thelinker.)

So this morning I was getting annoyed at the small amount of RAM inmy laptop.  Since I recently (after having the laptop for over a year)got Linux to use my CPU at full speed instead of half speed (by addingDEVICE="acpi" to /etc/cpuspeed.conf), memoryhas really seemed to be the limiting factor.  (Well, it has a slow disktoo.)  I've also been doing some things that use a lot of memory lately.I wondered why I only got 256 MiB of RAM in the first place—thatdidn't seem like something I'd do.  So, with the thought of buying moreRAM in mind, I pulled out the folder that had the receipt for my laptopto see whether I had an empty memory slot or 2 128 MiB DIMMs.

And the receipt said I had ordered 512 MiB of memory.  Butfree says I have 256 MiB, and the BIOS agrees.  And I don'treally ever remember this machine having 512 MiB.  So I opened up thelaptop, and, lo and behold, there were 2 256 MiB DIMMs in there.  A fewexperiments showed that one of the two memory slots was bad.  And themachine is already out of warranty (since I got a short warranty, whichfor me is usually a better deal, especially since I'm never sure whetherDell will honor the warranty after I've installed Linux).

I really need a better memory of what I ordered.  Or better memory.Or something.  But maybe I'll at least remember not to order laptopsfrom Dell again.****************************************

Reading the XSLTused[1] for the newsfeed on the new mozilla.org webpage[2]inspired me to finish a project I started quite a whileago[3]—making an RSS feed for this weblog.  After reading the oneexample XSLT file, I did the rest using only the XSLT spec[4] and theXPath spec[5].So I now have an RSS feed[6] produced by an XSLT transformation sheet[7] (I don't likethe use of the word “stylesheet” for XSLT).  And it'sapparently even valid[8].

Writing it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, although I am somewhatdisappointed by the inability of XSLT to re-transform trees (i.e., usean already transformed tree, in the form of a resulttree fragment[9] bound to a variable, as the source tree for anadditional transformation).  I worked around the problem using a namedtemplate and xsl:call-template[10].At least I think it's something XSLT can't do—at least I couldn'tsee how in the spec.

Item: Intranet mode? <http://dbaron.org/log/2004-06#e20040621a>

If Microsoft isgoingto develop IE again[1], I challenge them to move most oftheir non-standard behavior out of quirks mode and into an “Intranetmode”.

Most of the quirky behavior of IE for Windows isn't actually neededto display Web sites correctly.  It'sneeded for “Intranet” sites that have been designed to work withonly one browser.  Backwards-compatibility for corporate, academic, andgovernment “Intranets” is a perfectly good reason to want toproduce software that continues to display such sites, but it's noreason to inflict such software on the Web.  This would make IE'shandling of most web pages much more standard and lessen one of the mainways IE's near-monopoly discourages competition.
