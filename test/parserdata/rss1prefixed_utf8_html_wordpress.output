<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since politics is (are?) on my mind lately, I want to point out
an interesting site, <a shape="rect" href="http://politics.beasts.org/">Political
Survey</a>, which I first discovered when <a shape="rect" href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/02/02/mapping-things-out/">Eric
Meyer pointed it out</a> back in February.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It's interesting because it <a shape="rect" href="http://politics.beasts.org/rationale.shtml">uses principal
component analysis</a> to derive the axes from the data, rather than
trying to pick axes in advance.  It's also interesting because the most
significant axis it finds is the traditional left/right axis, but the
second axis isn't the libertarian/authoritarian axis that some assert
should be the second axisrather, it's a pragmatic/idealistic
axis.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I've taken the survey twice, once in February and once today.  My
results were similar:  I was in the left/pragmatic <a shape="rect" href="http://politics.beasts.org/scripts/eigenvectors">quadrant</a> both
times.  (In February, I was -4.08 on right/left and +5.17 on
pragmatic/idealistic.  Today I was -3.63 on right/left and +4.65 on
pragmatic/idealistic.)</p>

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<li>My 1GB DIMM arrived Monday, and it works fine.  With memory prices
these days, getting that is much easier than worrying about fixing a bad
memory slot.</li>

<li>CSS error reporting is now enabled in trunk Mozilla builds.  Check
out the Javascript Console.</li>

<li>I compiled a custom Linux kernel Tuesday to try to get suspend and
resume working on my laptop, but it didn't help.  My display still
doesn't wake up on resume.  And perhaps other things don't either.  It's
a little hard to tell.  (The patches were the first patch and the second
variant of the second patch on a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.loria.fr/~thome/d600/#update">page about Linux on the
Dell D600</a>.  I have a Dell Inspiron 5150, but the video card is the
same).  I'll probably continue trying to get it working another time.</li>

<li>I wish GNU ld's <code>--gc-sections</code> option worked for shared
libraries.  (Even working when shared libraries are visible within five
miles would be nice!)  The main thing this would help Mozilla with is
getting rid of unneeded copies of constructors and destructors that <a shape="rect" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>'s C++ compiler emits.  And probably
also some unneeded vtables.  And maybe a good bit of other stuff.
(gcc could probably be a little better, but it's really a job for the
linker.)</li>

Title: Bad memory

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So this morning I was getting annoyed at the small amount of RAM in
my laptop.  Since I recently (after having the laptop for over a year)
got Linux to use my CPU at full speed instead of half speed (by adding
<code>DEVICE=&quot;acpi&quot;</code> to <code>/etc/cpuspeed.conf</code>), memory
has really seemed to be the limiting factor.  (Well, it has a slow disk
too.)  I've also been doing some things that use a lot of memory lately.
I wondered why I only got 256 MiB of RAM in the first placethat
didn't seem like something I'd do.  So, with the thought of buying more
RAM in mind, I pulled out the folder that had the receipt for my laptop
to see whether I had an empty memory slot or 2 128 MiB DIMMs.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And the receipt said I had ordered 512 MiB of memory.  But
<code>free</code> says I have 256 MiB, and the BIOS agrees.  And I don't
really ever remember this machine having 512 MiB.  So I opened up the
laptop, and, lo and behold, there were 2 256 MiB DIMMs in there.  A few
experiments showed that one of the two memory slots was bad.  And the
machine is already out of warranty (since I got a short warranty, which
for me is usually a better deal, especially since I'm never sure whether
Dell will honor the warranty after I've installed Linux).</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I really need a better memory of what I ordered.  Or better memory.
Or something.  But maybe I'll at least remember not to order laptops
from Dell again.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reading the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.mozilla.org/webtools/bonsai/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla-org/tools/feed2html.xsl&amp;rev=1.1.2.2&amp;cvsroot=/cvsroot">XSLT
used</a> for the newsfeed on the <a shape="rect" href="http://website-beta.mozilla.org/">new mozilla.org webpage</a>
inspired me to finish a project I started <a shape="rect" href="http://dbaron.org/log/2003-09#e20030909a">quite a while
ago</a>making an RSS feed for this weblog.  After reading the one
example XSLT file, I did the rest using only the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116">XSLT spec</a> and the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116">XPath spec</a>.
So I now have an <a shape="rect" href="rss1">RSS feed</a> produced by an <a shape="rect" href="make-rss-transform">XSLT transformation sheet</a> (I don't like
the use of the word stylesheet for XSLT).  And it's
apparently even <a shape="rect" href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdbaron.org%2Flog%2Frss1">valid</a>.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Writing it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, although I am somewhat
disappointed by the inability of XSLT to re-transform trees (i.e., use
an already transformed tree, in the form of a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116#section-Result-Tree-Fragments">result
tree fragment</a> bound to a variable, as the source tree for an
additional transformation).  I worked around the problem using a named
template and <code><a shape="rect" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116#section-Result-Tree-Fragments">xsl:call-template</a></code>.
At least I think it's something XSLT can't doat least I couldn't
see how in the spec.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If Microsoft is
<a shape="rect" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmassy/archive/2004/06/16/157263.aspx">going
to develop IE again</a>, I challenge them to move most of
their non-standard behavior out of quirks mode and into an Intranet
mode.</p>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the quirky behavior of IE for Windows isn't actually needed
to display Web sites correctly.  It's
needed for Intranet sites that have been designed to work with
only one browser.  Backwards-compatibility for corporate, academic, and
government Intranets is a perfectly good reason to want to
produce software that continues to display such sites, but it's no
reason to inflict such software on the Web.  This would make IE's
handling of most web pages much more standard and lessen one of the main
ways IE's near-monopoly discourages competition.</p>
